2008/09/03  9:39:31  phil
Changed the handling of the registration of Qt meta-types to for PyQt's
improved QVariant support.


2008/08/30 18:25:14  phil
Added support for variables in templates.


2008/08/30 16:09:03  phil
Simplified the handling of a wrapper slots (maybe the original code was a
hangover from SIP v3).
Enum slots should now work.


2008/08/29 19:26:18  phil
Reverted the removal of the support in the build systen for
QMAKE_LFLAGS_CONSOLE* and QMAKE_LFLAGS_WINDOWS* as they are required when
building PyQt3 with MinGW.

Added support for class templates containing enums.


2008/08/25 23:13:21  phil

Released as v4.7.7.


2008/07/26 23:24:29  phil
If a slot of an object whose C++ instance is being (or has been) destroyed is
invoked then the call to the slot is no longer skipped. It is left to the slot
itself to determine the state of the C++ instance so that Python slots can
execute as normal. Note that this is a slight change of behaviour as a Qt slot
will now raise an exception rather than being ignored.


2008/07/22 23:37:09  phil
C++ structs are now handled the same as classes as far as super-classes,
annotations etc. are concerned.


2008/07/22 19:29:14  phil
Preserve any exception when calling __dtor__().


2008/07/06 17:20:40  phil
Add the first child wrapper to the output of sip.dump().
Fixed a reference count bug introduced when allowing a Python reimplementation
to be any callable and not just a method.


2008/06/15 22:21:01  phil
The code that handles exceptions now acquires the GIL before releasing any
temporary instances.


2008/06/15 16:10:52  phil
Fixed a bug where the strings of names of the methods of class templates
weren't being generated.


2008/06/15 12:37:05  phil
Fixed problems with module numbering when using consolidated modules.


2008/06/12 13:33:02  phil
The number of arguments to __getitem__, __setitem__ and __delitem__ is now
properly checked.


2008/06/07 15:07:47  phil
Fixed a GIL state bug with %RaiseCode.


2008/06/03 15:12:50  phil
Fixed a SIP crash when using %Exception.


2008/06/03  9:16:59  phil
Increased the size of the some temporary arrays so that there is no chance they
will overflow.


2008/05/30 19:20:19  phil
Hopefully fixed a regression introduced when allowing ctor %MethodCode to
indicate that the next signature should be tried.


2008/05/20 16:54:49  phil
Released as v4.7.6.


2008/05/19 15:08:13  phil

No longer pass arguments to object.__new__() as it is deprecated in Python
v2.6.


2008/05/18 22:59:23  phil

Updated the win32-msvc2005 spec file.
The manifest file for .exe files is now installed.


2008/05/17 12:09:12  phil
Added support for MSVC 2008 to the build system.
Handle quotes in spec files properly.


2008/05/16 19:10:20  phil
Update the spec file for the Intel compiler - v10.x is now required.


2008/05/13 10:43:44  phil
Released as v4.7.5.


2008/05/11 10:09:20  phil
Fixed the last fix.


2008/05/10 11:42:19  phil

stupidly kept it.


2008/05/09 13:32:23  phil
Build system fixes from the move to Ubuntu.


2008/05/07 22:14:27  phil
If a type has a public copy ctor (or is a mapped type that doesn't have
/NoRelease/ specified) then it is assumed to also have a public assignment
operator and an assignment helper function is generated.


2008/05/05 12:02:02  phil
Updated the NEWS file.
Documentation tweaks.


2008/05/05 10:38:50  phil

Exposed sip_api_is_exact_wrapper_type() to the Qt support.


2008/05/04 17:56:05  phil
Improved the handling of variable %GetCode and %SetCode so that, for class
variables, the referencing type is passed as sipPyType.


2008/05/03 13:49:24  phil
Assume that if an init function doesn't create a C/C++ object but successfully
parsed a signature then it was because handwritten code decided after the parse
that it didn't like the signature.


2008/04/28 21:28:12  phil
The %MethodCode supplied to a dtor is now placed in the release function and
not the dealloc function.


2008/04/24 12:33:10  phil
Fixed a bug that broke binary operators for types with handwritten conversion
code that supported tuples.
Fixed a bug cleaning up arguments for unary operators for types with
handwritten conversion code.


2008/04/21 17:16:03  phil
Added sipParseType() to the internal API (though it may yet prove not to be
needed).


2008/04/21  0:01:53  phil
Deprecated sipEmitToSlot() in favour of the new sipInvokeSlot() (which handles
return values from slots).


2008/04/20 22:37:08  phil
Added the /NoArgParser/ function annotation.


2008/04/19 23:15:19  phil
sipConvertToVoidPtr() is now part of the public API.
Added the /NoRelease/ mapped type annotation.


2008/04/18 16:40:31  phil
Made the sipConvertFromConstVoidPtr(), sipConvertFromConstVoidPtrAndSize(),
sipConvertFromVoidPtr() and sipConvertFromVoidPtrAndSize() functions part of
the public API.


2008/04/17 19:09:59  phil
Changes to make sure that the /ArraySize/ annotation works for arrays with
more than 2^31 elements.
Added the 'g' and 'G' format characters to sipBuildResult(), sipCallMethod()
and sipParseResult() and deprecated the 'a' and 'A' characters they replace.


2008/04/15 19:54:04  phil
Various template related bug fixes and enhancements need by PyQt's Phonon
module.


2008/04/13 17:54:36  phil
Taught the build system about the phonon module.


2008/04/13 16:48:29  phil
Taught the build system about the QtXmlPatterns module.


2008/04/13 15:26:57  phil
Taught the build system about the QtWebKit module.


2008/04/12 23:33:23  phil
Taught the build system about the QtHelp module.


2008/04/10 10:18:05  phil
Backed out the workaround for -Wl,--no-undefined for Qt v4.4rc1 as Trolltech
have agreed to remove it for the final release.


2008/04/09 17:25:30  phil
Added the sip_api_convert_from_const_void_ptr(),
sip_api_convert_from_void_ptr_and_size() and
sip_api_convert_from_const_void_ptr_and_size() functions to the internal API.
Added the /ResultSize/ argument annotation.
The sip.voidptr ctor now takes optional size and writeable flags.
Added the getsize(), setsize(), getwriteable() and setwriteable() methods to
sip.voidptr.
sip.voidptr now support the buffer protocol if it has an associated size.
All these changes mean that sip.voidptr (when wrapped with the buffer()
builtin) can be used to read and update arbitrary memory locations, and that
Qt v4.4's support for memory mapped files can be exploited.


2008/04/08 16:45:10  phil
Changed the build system to remove any -Wl,--no-undefined given to LFLAGS when
creating a Makefile.  (Needed for Qt v4.4.)


2008/03/28 14:44:51  phil
No longer explicitly scope global operators with "::" as this seems to break
operators defined in C++ as friends.


2008/02/29 18:44:22  phil
Added the (internal) NoQMetaObject annotation.


2008/02/27 15:45:22  phil
A pointer to a QObject sub-class's staticMetaObject is now accessible from the
Python type object.


2008/02/25 15:41:03  phil
Virtual catchers no longer acquire the GIL when it is known that there is no
Python reimplementation.


2008/02/25 14:11:37  phil
Allow Python reimplementations of C++ virtuals to be any callable rather than
just a method.
Fixed a bug where the exception complaining that an abstract C++ method must be
reimplemented wasn't being displayed.


2008/02/24 17:21:59  phil
Extended the support for objects that implement Python's buffer interface to
any 'char' or 'char *' types, and not just arrays.


2008/02/24 15:46:59  phil
Arguments annotated as arrays can now be any object that supports the Python
buffer interface rather than just strings.


2008/02/13 12:24:12  phil
Extended the use of distutils for 64-bit systems based on Rex Dieter's patch.
Also removed the use of sys.lib in the hope that it's no longer needed for
SuSE, Mandriva etc.


2008/02/12 13:53:13  phil
Released as v4.7.4.


2008/02/09 15:10:06  phil
"self" is no longer included in method declarations in API files.
Updated the NEWS file.


2008/02/02 13:54:40  phil
Backed out the support for the reflected special methods - they aren't needed.


2008/02/01 23:07:30  phil
Added support for the reflected number special methods, ie. __radd__, __rsub__,
__rmul__, __rdiv__, __rmod__, __rlshift__, __rrshift__, __rand__, __ror__, and
__rxor__.


2008/02/01 10:23:17  phil
Changed the qt_metacast() support so that it will work with PyQt binaries built
without the support.


2008/01/31 15:21:59  phil
Changed the implementation of qt_metacast() to be consistent with qt_metacall()
etc.


2008/01/30 21:27:35  phil
qt_metacast() is now automatically generated and handles Python sub-classes.


2008/01/23 22:11:20  phil
Changed the output of "sip -V" so that it is just the latest version number
(rather than the last release and the latest version number).


2008/01/22 12:56:02  phil
Fixed a bug in working out the header files to include for exceptions.
Fixed many warning messages.


2008/01/20 15:40:21  phil
Rely more on distutils for determining directories to deal with Leopard's
non-standard choices.


2008/01/18 10:16:56  phil
Fixed a code generation bug when a function had multiple /Out/ arguments that
were mapped types.

Fixed the documentation for MethodCode and the standard binary operators.
Updated the copyright notices.


2007/12/28 12:31:03  phil

Released as v4.7.2.


2007/12/05 11:39:32  phil
Fixed a bug in handling virtual comparison operators that caused recursion when
trying to call the C++ version from a Python reimplementation.


2007/11/30 18:26:51  phil
Fixed the previous fix for Windows.


2007/11/30 18:05:19  phil
Fixed a bug in sip.dump() for Python prior to v2.5.


2007/11/17 11:49:31  phil
Tweaked the way the slot flags are passed to ensure binary compatibility with
modules built with earlier versions.


2007/11/16 19:38:05  phil
Added the /SingleShot/ argument annotation.
Increased the minor number of the API version.
Added the 'g' format character to the argument parser.
Deprecated the Qt support function to create a universal slot and replaced it
with one that is passed a set of flags (specifically the one that identifies a
single shot slot).


2007/11/08  9:50:02  phil
When searching the object map, objects with a 0 reference count are now
ignored.


2007/10/26 17:06:13  phil
Applied Giovanni's patch to make PythonModuleMakefile skip .svn and CVS
directories.

The XML export now has an optional "pickle" attribute on the "Class" element.


2007/10/14 15:52:52  phil
Tiny documentation fix.


2007/10/09 14:23:08  phil
Various fixes for bugs in the handling of protected classes.  (There may also
be an impact on the handling of protected enums.)


2007/10/07 17:06:12  phil
Added the documentation section describing how to access the SIP API when
embedding Python in a C/C++ application.


2007/10/03 19:47:14  phil
Added the TransferThis function annotation.


2007/09/28 17:03:19  phil
Released as v4.7.1.


2007/09/26 14:46:32  phil
Fixed a bug in the object map code that meant an object could get skipped when
searching - which could cause a crash if it was the last one.


2007/09/21  6:19:25  phil
Fixed a longstanding bug when calling a protected method of a super-class by
passing self as the first argument and the type of self uses multiple
inheritance but the super-class doesn't.


2007/09/19 22:34:09  phil
When garbage collecting, only check if a wrapped object currently has proxy
slots if at least one was created at some time in the past.


2007/09/14 18:41:56  phil
Fixed various bugs related to protected classes in namespaces.


2007/09/14 12:35:04  phil
Allowed typedef'ed names to be used in super-class lists.


2007/09/04 22:26:36  phil
Fixed a bug where virtuals in a class template were being added to the module
in which it was defined (rather than just the modules in which it was used).


2007/09/02 16:12:48  phil
Added a workaround for a bug in Stackless Python.


2007/08/30 15:11:43  phil
The digits to the right of the decimal point in a floating point literal are
now optional.


2007/08/29 17:37:31  phil
Fixed a bug where unsupported variable types were rejected even though %GetCode
and %SetCode were provided.


2007/08/11 15:32:30  phil
Un-track a wrapped object before calling the C++ dtor.  Without this the
garbage collector can be invoked from another thread (because the GIL is
released before calling the C++ dtor) which can result in a crash.


2007/08/10 17:55:47  phil
Whoops - forgot to make 'f' and 'F' optional.


2007/08/10 17:26:45  phil
Allow a trailing 'f' or 'F' in floating point literals.


2007/08/04 15:36:26  phil
Fixed a bug with class templates defined in an enclosing scope (ie. a namespace
or another class).


2007/07/30 17:01:42  phil
Released as v4.7.


2007/07/28 12:08:32  phil
Fixed a memory leak with mapped types with the /Out/ annotation.


2007/07/27 17:39:06  phil
Fixed a bug preventing wrapped C++ slots from being disconnected.


2007/07/14 15:31:37  phil
Rather than only lambda functions being given an extra reference when used as a
slot, anything other that a method or wrapped C function is given an extra
reference.  Specifically this means that partial functions can now be used as
slots.


2007/07/04 21:16:25  phil
Relaxed the restriction that /Out/ arguments couldn't be const.


2007/06/25 17:17:16  phil
Fixed a compiler warning message about an unused argument in generated code.


2007/06/25 16:50:15  phil
Fixed a bug in the previous fix so that it only applies to mapped types.


2007/06/25 12:32:16  phil
Fixed a bug where template based types where overwriting the header code of any
previously defined type based on the same interface file.


2007/06/23 17:20:22  phil
Consolidated modules are now generated as either C or C++ (rather than always
C) so that the name cache names are consistently mangled.


2007/06/22 19:27:21  phil
Fixed a build system problem for PyQt on Windows against a static Qt.


2007/06/22 16:05:25  phil
Fixed silly code generation typo.


2007/06/22  9:46:32  phil
Changed the build system so that missing macros default to being empty rather
than causing an error.  (Qt v4.3.0 contains such a case.)


2007/06/20 15:52:52  phil
Split the consolidated module concept into separate consolidated and composite
module types, which significantly simplifies things.


2007/06/19 23:48:55  phil
Updated some comments in the build system.


2007/06/19 20:34:53  phil
Fixed a bug in the sip module consolidated module support. Otherwise everything
seems to work.


2007/06/19 16:53:41  phil
More consolidated module refactoring.


2007/06/18 21:54:50  phil
More consolidated module refactoring.  PyQt4 with only QtCore enabled now
compiles.


2007/06/16 14:42:46  phil
More consolidated module support.


2007/06/12 18:43:41  phil
Hopefully fixed a bug in the handling of the 'C' and 'D' format characters in
sipParseResult().


2007/06/12 18:16:44  phil
More refactoring for consolidated module support.  SIP no longer generates lots
of .h files.
Note that SIP is now less tolerant of missing #includes in %TypeHeaderCode and
%ModuleHeaderCode.


2007/06/04 21:07:49  phil
Removed the need to generate the shadow class definition in a header file and
put it in the original class's C++ file instead.


2007/06/03 18:31:08  phil
More consolidated module refactoring.


2007/06/01 22:16:36  phil
Fixed a missing return in parser.y.

A bit more consolidated module support.


2007/05/28 17:07:25  phil
More work on consolidated modules.


2007/05/27 23:53:55  phil
The component stub modules (ie. those requested with the -p flag) are now
generated.


2007/05/27 17:30:17  phil
Added the stubs of the -n and -p command line options for the remaining
consolidated module support.
Documented the %ConsolidatedModule directive.


2007/05/24 19:44:54  phil
Completed the implementation of %ConsolidatedModule for the simple case (where
the consolidated module populates itself from the component modules).


2007/05/23 22:50:07  phil
A bit more refactoring for the consolidated module support.


2007/05/23 20:11:52  phil
When deciding if an instance is already wrapped, sip only considers if the
candidate is a sub-class of the expected class.  (Before it used to consider if
the candidate was a super-class of the expected class as well.  However this
shouldn't be necessary as the candidates class should be correct if all the
sub-class convertor code is working properly.)


2007/05/23 18:34:27  phil
Added the start of the support for %ConsolidatedModule.


2007/05/20 14:37:00  phil
Added the dump() funtion to the sip module.


2007/05/13 18:19:11  phil
Added sipTransferBreak() for removing hidden references without changing
ownership.


2007/05/13 12:23:38  phil
Added support for /Transfer/ as a function annotation.


2007/05/12 17:45:54  phil
Added the build system hooks for PyQt's QtScript module.


2007/05/12 11:26:54  phil
Fixed some parser problems related to versioning.


2007/05/11 17:52:08  phil

Generated the sipClass_* for namespaces.


2007/05/07 11:16:19  phil
More fixes to mapped type templates - should be Ok now.


2007/05/04 23:13:51  phil
Fixed a couple of documentation bugs regarding exceptions.


2007/05/03 11:37:21  phil
Fixed a bug where generated .h files for template argument types were being
included in the mapped type rather than the mapped type's own .h file.


2007/04/28 13:49:13  phil
Removed the need for the copy_reg module. This marks the completion if the
pickle support.


2007/04/28 12:22:27  phil
Pickling nested types now works.


2007/04/28 10:49:23  phil
Minor refactoring of the pickle code prior to adding support for nested
classes.


2007/04/27 11:21:08  phil
Named enums that are nested within other types can now be pickled.  (Note that
the pickle format for classes will be changed in the next few days to allow
nested classes to be pickled in the same way.)


2007/04/26 16:49:44  phil
More improvements to the pickle code.


2007/04/26 16:08:54  phil
Slight improvement to the generated pickle code.

Removed the None implementations of __reduce__ and __reduce_ex__ and fixed the
segfault that pickling was causing.


2007/04/10 15:27:04  phil
Released as v4.6.


2007/04/07 17:37:56  phil
Changed the API file generation to generate the __init__ form of a ctor as well
as the callable type form.


2007/04/02 22:45:04  phil
Updated the NEWS file.


2007/04/02 22:44:16  phil
Added the -n flag to configure.py to build universal binaries on MacOS/X.


2007/04/02 19:07:30  phil
Fixed a MinGW warning message.


2007/04/02 16:03:32  phil
Backed out the save and restore of the exception state in sipWrapper_dealloc()
as it can get called when there is no current thread state (which results in a
segfault).


2007/04/02 15:23:53  phil
Updated the NEWS file.


2007/04/02 14:06:29  phil
Fixed a bug handling sub-class convertor code with multiple inheritance.


2007/04/02 12:10:54  phil
Virtuals that return a wchar_t * now keep then free the previous result to
limit the possible memory leaks.


2007/04/01 16:28:23  phil
Fixed a bug in the wchar_t support with const wchar_t * arguments.
Fixed a bug in the wchar_t support with char and wchar_t being considered
equivalent.


2007/03/26 19:28:28  phil
Fixed problem where lambda slots connected to QObject.destroyed() were cleared
before the signal was emitted.


2007/03/25 13:45:56  phil
Completed the wchar_t support.


2007/03/25  0:00:12  phil
Added support for wchar_t - undocumented and certainly untested.


2007/03/10 15:23:46  phil
No longer generate the forward declaration of an opaque class.  It shouldn't be
necessary and means that the class could be a C structure.


2007/03/02 22:48:39  phil
SIP should now handle DOS format files on UNIX systems.


2007/02/27 13:25:26  phil
Undeprecated the -g command line option.
Added the /HoldGIL/ annotation.

Leave it to the Qt support code to release the GIL when connecting signals.


2007/02/20 18:22:48  phil

owned by C++ but the owning object had been garbage collected.


2007/02/18 16:00:12  phil
Fixed a bug in the clearing of reference cycles with lambda slots.  Although
the slot is visited, it is no longer cleared - that is left to the proxy dtor.


2007/02/16 18:47:13  phil
Fixed a bug in the build system for QtDesigner on Windows.
The Q_OBJECT support code now uses metaObject() rather than staticMetaObject
because the latter is private in the ActiveQt classes.

Added support for /TypeFlags/.
Added sipFindClass() and sipFindNamedEnum() to the public API.


2007/02/06 22:20:59  phil

Added the hooks to allow PyQt to build a proper meta-object when a new Python
class is defined.


2007/01/25 13:22:06  phil

can't be called from Python.


2007/01/22 22:02:07  phil
Added support for the QtMetaClass option.
Added sipParseSignature() to the private Qt API.
(Both of the above are needed for David Boddie's support for Python widgets in

Extended the cyclic garbage collector support for lambda slots so it works with
SIGNALs as well as PYSIGNALs.
Incremented the SIP API version number to 3.4.


2007/01/21 14:55:47  phil
Fixed garbage collection support for lambda slots (at the moment only when the

Added #undef slots to sip.h for when embedding Python 2.3 in Qt applications.


2007/01/16 13:54:14  phil

Allowed /TransferThis/ to be specified more than once.


2007/01/15 13:43:51  phil
Updated the copyright notices.
Fixed a reentrancy problem in wrapping objects obtained from C/C++ (thanks to
Giovanni Bajo for the fix).


2007/01/10 16:24:13  phil
Added support for __truediv__ and __itruediv__ by making them synonyms for
__div__ and __idiv__.

Fixed a MacOS specific bug in create_wrapper() in the build system.


2006/12/20 15:13:08  phil

Fixed the internal build system for later versions of docutils.


2006/12/06 18:09:27  phil
"PyQt_PyObject" is now used instead of "PyObject *".
lamda functions can now be used as slots.


2006/11/26 18:19:36  phil
Fixed an incorrect assumption that if a Python wrapper of a C++ owned object
was being garbage collected then its Python children (ie. things it owns)
should also be garbage collected.  It may be that the parent is a "temporary"
object (eg. the argument of a reimplementation of a virtual) but the children
are "permanent".  The case in PyQt is the parent argument of
QAbstractItemDelegate.createEditor().


2006/11/25 17:09:54  phil
PEP 353 fixes from Ulli.


2006/11/25 10:48:15  phil

Removed the -n flag to sip now I think I've decided how to change code
completion in QScintilla.


2006/09/22 18:17:25  phil

Added support for QAxContainer in the build system.


2006/07/19 19:52:25  phil

More Python v2.5 changes.


2006/07/15 22:27:26  phil

Fixed the use of sys.lib in configure.py.


2006/07/06 22:17:58  phil
configure.py uses sys.lib if it is defined (for some 64 bit Linux distros).

Always call a dtor if there is one, even if we can't see how the instance could
have been created.

Added sip_config_args to sipconfig.py.
Added __hex__() to sip.voidptr.


2006/06/19 15:57:08  phil

Fixed the implementation of /TransferBack/ for virtuals.
Changed all API arguments that take a format string from char * to const char *
for Solaris.

appears first.)


2006/05/18 23:28:21  phil
More XML generation changes.


2006/05/16 23:27:00  phil

Fixed some compiler warnings.


2006/05/01 14:41:18  phil

get around a (not properly understood) problem with modules that wrap C++
exceptions.


2006/04/15 19:21:04  phil
The build system now complains if a property is used in a spec file when no

that pickle knows they can't be pickled.


2006/03/20 23:13:23  phil
Fixed the special handling of the __dict__ attribute so that it doesn't apply
to Python sub-classes of wrapped classes.


2006/03/19 14:21:56  phil
Documentation tweaks.
Generate sipSelf for ctor %MethodCode now that it's existence is documented.
Fixed a second place where slots with no underlying C++ instance might be

Fixed a leaking weak reference object.
Another attempt at fixing calling slots where the underlying C++ instance has

2006/03/04 17:55:49  phil
Fixed a regression in the wrappers around protected methods.


2006/03/04 10:48:35  phil
Suppressed the exception about the underlying object disappearing when calling

Added sipLong_AsUnsignedLong() to work around a bug in PyLong_AsUnsignedLong().


2006/02/26 23:19:31  phil

2006/02/26  0:41:23  phil
Tore up the recent changes for handling cross module namespaces.  A namespace
is now defined in each module it is used.  That makes things easier to
implement and should be less confusing for the user.  The API and data
structures should now be stable.

Implemented disconnects for universal signals.


2006/02/18 21:04:05  phil
Implemented support for signal arguments of type PyObject *.
Implemented support for shortcircuited Python signals (ie. just the name
without arguments) that will only work with other shortcircuited Python signals
and Python slots - bit don't need to do any conversions between Python and C++.


2006/02/17 10:59:46  phil
Fixed bug in the implementation of /TransferBack/ in virtual handlers.
Fixed bug in methods with a void result and a single /Out/ argument that was a
mapped type or class.


2006/02/16 18:24:46  phil

Updated the documentation where it was still referring to the legacy type
convertors.

Removed the sipConvertTo_*() functions.
Removed sipConvertToCppTransfer().
Took all of the None handling out of %ConvertToTypeCode.


2006/01/28 20:11:45  phil
Fixed the support for __hash__.


2006/01/26 16:39:44  phil
Added %SIPNoEmitters to stop SIP generating signal emitters for a module and
any module that imports it.

Fixed a bug in sipTransferTo() that caused some objects to be garbage collected
while ownership was being transferred.
Check that abstract methods are only ever called as bound methods.


2006/01/19 17:57:01  phil
Updated the documentation for sipConnectRx().
The __dict__ attribute of a wrapper type now returns a regular dictionary
rather than a proxy (because PyDict_Next() doesn't iterate over proxies).


2006/01/14 16:40:04  phil
Fixed the searching of signal types.


2006/01/11  8:45:06  phil
The previous fix wasn't quite so trivial.


2006/01/11  8:17:58  phil

Fixed a couple of bugs with char * output arguments.


2005/10/24 16:58:17  phil
Applied fix from Giovanni Bajo to the build system where a macro was defined in

Fixed an assumption that a type created by sip.wrappertype would always be
derived from sip.wrapper causing a segfault.  (__metaclass__ might have been
used to invalidate the assumption.)

Fixed legacy C++ism from the Qt support hooks.


2005/10/11 21:12:02  phil

there from day one was a really, really stupid thing to do.)


2005/10/09 17:01:39  phil
Changed the handling of number slots to support the reverse operators.


2005/10/06 21:41:32  phil
Fixed bugs related to function arguments that were classes and had default
arguments that weren't function calls.


2005/10/06 20:24:43  phil

different modules.


2005/09/28 13:50:04  phil
Completed the support for template classes.


2005/09/27 21:16:14  phil
Started to add support for template classes.  Not yet complete, but shouldn't
have broken anything.


2005/09/25 15:10:20  phil
Function arguments can now have names (although they are ignored).
The "explicit" keyword is parsed (but not yet used).


2005/09/22 20:21:36  phil
The generated sipconfig.py no longer contains any Qt version specific
configuration data and so can be shared between Qt configurations.

Updated the documentation where it covers what Qt support is.
Universal slots no longer take part in cyclic garbage collection as they are
associated with C++ instances and not Python objects.


2005/09/07 20:53:06  phil
The Qt support framework is now C rather than C++.


2005/09/06 20:32:33  phil

and so it can support PyQt v3 and v4 without needing to be re-compiled.


2005/09/04 20:47:42  phil
More build system changes for Qt4.


2005/09/04 17:57:02  phil

Fixed bug in exception handling that caused a seg fault when generating code.


2005/08/22 20:39:42  phil

Applied some HP-UX and AIX portability fixes from Ulli.


2005/08/21 11:54:53  phil

2005/08/16 16:35:21  phil
Backed out the garbage collector fix yet again.  I now know what the real
problem & solution is.


2005/08/10 16:40:47  phil

2005/07/27 17:17:29  phil
Put back in the possible fix for weak references and cyclic garbage collection
so that it can be selectively tested.


2005/07/27 12:08:18  phil

Hopefully, finally, nailed the lexing of handwritten code.


2005/07/03 15:54:41  phil
Backed out some of the "fix" for Windows path separators.


2005/07/03 13:56:25  phil
Fixed segv trigged by a reference to __dict__ in an __init__ function before
the instance dictionary has been created.


2005/07/02 11:06:14  phil

leaves the problem with weak references.


2005/06/29 15:00:30  phil
Fixed segv with the new exception support when class or undefined exceptions
where used in throw specifier.
The build file now doesn't include non-existant C++ files for exceptions.


2005/06/26 22:03:27  phil
Implemented the support for %Exception.
The parsing of handwritten code still seems to have problems in that blank
lines seem to be ignored.  This seems to be a problem with flex (the rule
doesn't seem to be recognised for this condition).  Ignore until somebody
complains.

Fixed code generation bug in the new variable handling code.


2005/06/01 17:38:26  phil

Fixed bug with shadow classes if explicit C++ signatures were duplicates.


2005/04/23 11:46:33  phil
Fixed a leak where virtual handlers return a mapped type or a class with
handwritten conversion code.  (Thanks to James Emerton.)


2005/04/23 09:20:53  phil

garbage collector.


2005/04/02 18:54:31  phil
Abstract C++ classes can no longer be instantiated from Python - they can only
be sub-classed.
The above change needed the SIP API major version bumping.  The minor version
number has been added to the main module data structure to (hopefully) reduce
the need for this in future.


2005/04/02 10:12:46  phil
Replaced the new /NoConvertor/ annotation with an extended implementation of
/Constrained/.


2005/03/25 20:17:44  phil

Fixed missing cast in generated code.


2005/02/19 15:22:53  phil

initialisation function.  Added the -a flag to configure.py to restore the old
behaviour.


2005/02/04 18:29:16  phil
All modules are now stripped by default on installation.
Fixed a bug where namespaces' generated names were wrong so that they appeared
to go AWOL.


2005/01/29 10:15:15  phil
Synced build system with Qt v3.3.4.


2005/01/22 18:35:10  phil

before.  The new types are not yet exploited.


2004/11/13 19:07:52  phil
Generalise the build system treatment of INCDIR and LIBDIR to INCDIR* and
LIBDIR*.


2004/11/13 18:59:33  phil
Fixed a feature where a factory function with a /TransferThis/ would always
keep a C++ pointer, never finding out it was invalid, and mistakenly recognise
the address when it was re-used.

Fixed bad bugs in new slot proxy handling.
Exposed the voidptr, wrapper and wrappertype types in the sip module.

2004/10/01 16:59:42  phil
Initial support for the new dynamic signal handling that allows previously
unknown signals to be connected to Python callables (needed for ActiveX
support).  At the moment mapped types and enums aren't (yet) supported.  Qt
versions 1 and 2 aren't (yet) supported.  Untested on Windows.


2004/09/29 18:31:22  phil
Fixed significant bugs in the way the metatype was working.  Operators are now
properly inherited in sub-classes of wrapped classes.

Released as v4.1.1.


2004/09/23 20:46:59  phil
Really fixed the previous problem this time.  The return type is ignored, but
the re-implementation must be in a sub-class and not a different branch of the
class hierarchy.


2004/09/23 19:04:52  phil
Fixed a problem with classes with a virtual and a non-virtual with the same
signature but different return types in the hierarchy.

Improved the test to see if the + and * operators should mean concat and repeat
rather than add and multiply.


2004/09/10 22:33:28  phil
Re-implemented some of the virtual method handling so that the return type is
ignored when comparing signatures.  Not sure it is completely correct yet, but
PyQt seems to be fine.


2004/08/25 19:17:59  phil
Fixed const bug - only MSVC complains.

Added support for typedefs that define pointers to functions.


2004/08/17 13:58:53  phil
A method that starts a new thread will now make sure that a single thread state
is created - rather than forcing PyGILState_Ensure() to create a new one each
time.

Fixed bug in the internal build system.


2004/08/15 23:35:20  phil

2003/12/21 17:29:10  phil
Implemented sip.voidptr.asstring().


2003/12/21 12:57:43  phil
We now distinguish (automatically) between add and mul when applied to numbers
and sequences because they have slightly different APIs.
The sequence repeat and in-place repeat slots now don't convert their integer
argument to a Python object.
Number slots now support new-style numbers.


2003/12/16 20:00:33  phil
Changed the documentation so as not to suggest using -fno-rtti as it's bad
advice if you are using KDE.


2003/12/14 20:53:23  phil
Make sure we don't lie to Python by saying we support new-style numbers when we
don't (yet).
Number methods return Py_NotImplemented rather than raise an exception.

Tidying up of the new build system.  The sipconfig.py module has better support
for non-SCons build scripts.


2003/11/03 22:56:38  phil
Removed the old build system.
Added the $L macro to generate the list of source files as a Python list.


2003/11/03 19:44:27  phil
More changes to the new build system.  It now seems to work Ok for SIP, but not
yet tested under Windows.

Added the start of the new SCons based build system.


2003/10/29 13:50:47  phil

Make sure active virtual handlers don't look for Python methods after the
interpreter has gone.
Don't create a overwrite an instance dictionary when a wrapped object's
__init__ method is called.

Added support for handling functions that return values via pointers and
references.  (Virtual functions not yet handled.)


2003/10/24 08:35:18  phil
Added the -g flag and the /ReleaseGIL/ option to allow fine control over the
release of the GIL.


2003/10/23 18:28:27  phil

Renamed %PostInitialisationC++Code to %PostInitialisationCode.
Renamed %HeaderCode to %TypeHeaderCode or %ModuleHeaderCode depending on the
context.
Renamed %C++Code to %TypeCode or %ModuleCode depending on the context.
Allow structs within classes.
Added %CModule - SIP can now wrap C libraries as well as C++ libraries.


2003/10/22 18:42:08  phil
The object mapper now checks for super-classes and sub-classes when determining
if an C++ pointer has already been wrapped.
%Import, %Include and %OptionalInclude can now take a relative (UNIX style)
pathname.  The directory containing the file will also be searched for files
that it itself includes or imports.


2003/10/21 16:41:32  phil
Fixed a bug in the mapping of C++ addresses to Python objects that was probably
causing the occaisional "random" "underlying C++ object has been deleted"
exception to be raised.
Fixed a bug in sipconfig.py which meant that PyQt modules for MacOS were
misnamed.


2003/10/21 13:38:47  phil

Initial changes the build system to handle the Mac.
Portability fixes for Windows.


2003/10/19 10:21:37  phil
Now uses the new GIL functions (see PEP 311).  This means it is no longer
necessary to manage the GIL exactly right in handwritten code and makes it more
likely that code will work with non-SIP generated extension modules that don't
handle the GIL properly (ie. Boost).


2003/10/18 16:42:40  phil
Completed support for class variables.


2003/10/17 16:45:47  phil
Fixed a bug with ctors that had a Qt slot in their argument list (QToolButton
is the only example in Qt).

Fixed the handling of common strings so that there are no name clashes between
modules. This means that modules can be builtins of the interpreter.

Started on support for variables.


2003/10/16 15:52:11  phil
Added support for dir() of a wrapped type.

All examples now appear to work.
All unit tests work except for QString and QStringList.


2003/10/14 22:37:30  phil
Added sipTrace() to the module API.
More debugging - all tutorials mostly work (except for an odd problem when

2003/04/14 23:39:00  phil
All of PyQt should now compile.

ctors.


2003/04/13 12:37:49  phil
PyQt now compiles (except for the qtnetwork module because it includes nested
classes.)


2003/04/10 18:49:45  phil

Updated the (private) TODO list.


2002/05/25 16:23:27  phil

Fixed a bug in the object map code that was trying to free non-malloc'ed
memory.
Keep a separate flag as to whether C++ has an extra reference to the Python

doesn't recognise.


2002/04/23 09:09:07  phil
Fix to SIP_[UN]BLOCK_THREADS for when thread support is disabled.

create new threads.
Removed /ReleaseLock/ - the Python lock is released for any call to C++, not
just selected ones.
